      Growing the Commons exists to promote, support, and strengthen the Commons: a diverse ecosystem of community-driven systems, tools, and practices for producing, governing, and sustaining life’s essentials. Read more on our [About](/about) page.
      

       We recently started three online projects playing together to form an ecosystem: the [blog](https://growingcommons.substack.com/) for connecting with kindred spirits, the [forum](https://forum.growingthecommons.org/) for discussing, and the [wiki](https://knowledge.growingthecommons.org/) for curating knowledge (with no strict separation of course, all of them are for connecting people).
