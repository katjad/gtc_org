      Growing the Commons is a collaboration between organisations and
      individuals developing tools, ideas and practices that can help grow a
      commons movement to catalyse a transition as transformative as that from
      feudalism to capitalism. It's sorely needed.

Growing the Commons exists to promote, support, and strengthen the Commons: a diverse ecosystem of community-driven systems, tools, and practices for producing, governing, and sustaining life’s essentials.

We recently started three online projects playing together to form an ecosystem. They are still in their beginning stages, the latest addition being the Knowledge Commons: the [blog](https://growingcommons.substack.com/) for connecting with kindred spirits, the [forum](https://forum.growingthecommons.org/) for discussing, and the [wiki](https://knowledge.growingthecommons.org/) for curating knowledge (with no strict separation of course, all of them are for connecting people).
