      Growing the Commons is a collaboration between organisations and
      individuals developing tools, ideas and practices that can help grow a
      commons movement to catalyse a transition as transformative as that from
      feudalism to capitalism. It's sorely needed.  
      
      
      
      We recently started three online projects playing together to form an ecosystem: the [blog](https://growingcommons.substack.com/) for connecting with kindred spirits, the [forum](https://forum.growingthecommons.org/) for discussing, and the [wiki](https://knowledge.growingthecommons.org/) for curating knowledge (with no strict separation of course, all of them are for connecting people).
